# Game Hub
Welcome to the Game Hub repository! This repository hosts console-based games written in C. Currently, it includes a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C. The game supports two players and ends when one player achieves three in a row. The number entered by the players corresponds to the location on the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

How to Play
Run the program.
Player 1 selects their letter, followed by Player 2.
Players take turns choosing a square by entering a number from 1 to 9.
The game ends when one player gets three in a row or when the board is filled.
Usage
Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):

bash
Copy code
gcc Tic_Tac_Toe.c -o Tic_Tac_Toe
Run the compiled executable:

bash
Copy code
./Tic_Tac_Toe
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

Game Board
The game board is displayed after each move, showing the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe grid.

Expanding the Game Hub
Feel free to expand this Game Hub by adding more games to the repository. If you have a new game, you can create a separate file for it (e.g., Checker.c) and add the game logic there.

To add a new game:

Create a new C file for the game.
Implement the game logic in the new file.
Update the README file to include information about the new game.
Enjoy the Games!
Have fun playing the included games, and stay tuned for future additions to the Game Hub. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue in the repository.
